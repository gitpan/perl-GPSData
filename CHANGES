perl-GPSData

---- v 0.04 ()
-Forced the timezone to GMT in the tests in order to prevent hosts which do not have any timezone configured to fail the tests. This bug was caught by the CPAN testers team, thanks guys! :)
-Remembered to add a version to every module so that a search in CPAN should now return a proper list of modules;
-make test now automagically skipps the mysql tests if it cannot connect to a propper database on localhost;

---- v 0.03 (Apr 11 2003)
-Implemented the Collection class functionalities, which forced me to clean up a lot of other stuff;
-Finaly added the license text! :)
-The collection management has been made more generic and this unfortunately led to some minor changes in the database schema;
-Radical change in the way the storage is handled in order to maintain persistence in storage classes such as RAM;
-Created the storage class and made it a "object factory" that decides the correct type of storage to use and instantiates it;
-Stoped converting everything into lowercasae, I now store data as it is handled to me and compare it using lowercase;


---- v 0.02 (Mar 29 2003)
-Implemented a new storage method (RAM) which is used for the automated tests (whoch now pass!);
-Created a new class (Geo::GPS::Data::Storage) which handles the instantiating of the correct Storage sub-class object;
-The storage class choice is now influenced by parameters passed on the constructor of the Geo::GPS::Data object;
-Cleaner use of $@ to pass errors backwards;
-Cleaner class inner-structure specially in the Geo::GPS::Data::Waypoint class;
-Better error messages;

---- v 0.01 (Mar 26 2003)
-The glorious first release which failed the make test because of a storage dependency on mysql which I overlooked.
-Only handled waypoints and only to some degree.
