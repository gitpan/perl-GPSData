This package is still in it's infancy and these first releases are still pretty much alpha and serves first and foremost as a proof of concept and as a test-bed to try and catch as many mistakes and problems as possible so don't hold any features and especially any interfaces as sacred/written in stone. Things will probably change a lot before this is even deemed beta code!
Anyway, on with the To-Do / whish list:

-The search module is still empty;
-Specific Groups (routes and track-logs) are not yet implemented. They are next on the list;
-The pods could be substantially better. I know this but I whish to see if anyone actually complains. I don't expect to get a large audience for this package and depending in the mileage of those who may get to use it this may be enough... Yes, I should be ashamed of myself; :)
-Test to see if a correct database actualy exists before runing the storage_mysql tests...
-Fully document the parameters taken by every method and (even more important) all the return values;
-Sync the POD files with the actual code;
-Make the collection tests more covilized (not comparing objects contents directly) and use something like a Test::Herness module to call the same test file but with different storage instances instead of simply duplicating the code).
